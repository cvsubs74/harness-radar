# Progress log

Append-only. Each session adds an entry. Never rewrite history.

Format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — <event>
- <bullet 1>
- <bullet 2>
```

Events include: `kickoff`, `F<NNN> <title>`, `retro F<NNN>`, `shipped F<NNN>`, `note`.

---

<!-- Future entries appended below. The first will be the /kickoff entry. -->

## 2026-05-26 19:02 — note
- Discussion-only session: assessed whether the engineering-workflow harness scales to complex server+client products.
- No code, features, or harness files changed. No /kickoff run yet — features.json still empty.
- Conclusion: harness discipline (acceptance criteria, ADRs, agent pipeline, append-only log) ports to any scale; specific tooling (features.json as SoT, one-feature-per-session, worktree parallelism) is sized for solo/small-team work.

## 2026-05-26 21:30 — note
- Harness rewrite: GitHub Issues are now the source of truth (features.json removed).
- Plan executed in 8 commits (c7b707b → 5c09f91): foundation scripts, GH issue forms/PR template/CODEOWNERS, agent specs, worktree scripts, slash commands, hooks, top-level docs, and final deletion of features.json + schema.
- Plan file: /Users/csubramanian@onetrust.com/.claude/plans/toasty-cooking-treehouse.md
- Outstanding: .claude/settings.json needs 4 new Bash permits for scripts/gh-*.sh (auto-mode classifier blocked the edit). Surfaced for manual application.
- Not pushed — local commits awaiting user's call on push.
